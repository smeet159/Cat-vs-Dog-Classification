# Cat-vs-Dog-Classification

The ultimate goal of this project is to create a system that can detect cats and dogs. Here I've deployed convolutinal neural network model to identify whether the given picture is of cat or dog.

The model is trained with the help of 25000 images of cat and dog and tested against 12500 images.

The code is divide into 5 parts.
1)loading of the image dataset
2)Derive the labels from the name of the jpg file
3)Data pre-proscessing
4)feed the image data into the network model
5)fitting of the data 
6)prediction of the image

Libraries used: 1.openCV 2.tflearn 3.numpy 
 
The train and test dataset used here is at (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data)
